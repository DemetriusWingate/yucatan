The ‘Explore Yucatan’ Project is a website to attract travelers visiting the Yucatan Peninsula to Mexico’s top destinations for cultural experiences. 

Featured in this website are two media queries which you will notice breakpoints when expanding the window from mobile to desktop view. Also, aligned all images and text to fit the screen size. 

Next, you will notice the navigation bar that collapses when displays on smaller devices. 

Finally, to satisfy the JavaScript portion of the project I’ve validated the “Newsletter Form” by displaying an alert message if the user forgets to leave a name, and once name is entered a message that thanks them for signing up.
